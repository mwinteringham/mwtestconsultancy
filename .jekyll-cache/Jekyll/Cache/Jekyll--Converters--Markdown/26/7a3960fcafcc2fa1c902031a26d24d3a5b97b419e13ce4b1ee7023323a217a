I"í<p>During my career as a software tester, there have been many memorable points. But two that are very important to me are the time I gave my talk first talk <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/mwinteringham/whats-so-great-about-web-driver">Whatâ€™s so great about WebDriver</a> where I first shared my thoughts on our industries obsession with end-to-end UI driven automation amd WebDriver and when Richard Bradshaw came up to me afterwards and said â€œIâ€™m thinking the same thingâ€. Iâ€™m paraphrasing (it was a long time ago) but since then Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work with Richard to create something I am immensely proud of Automation in Testing (AiT), a mindset, approach and series of courses that can help you with your automation.</p>
