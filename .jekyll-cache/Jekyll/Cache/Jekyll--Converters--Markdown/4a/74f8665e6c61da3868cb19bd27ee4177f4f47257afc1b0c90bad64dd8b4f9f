I"ž<p>Since being introduced to <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> a few years back itâ€™s become one of the main tools I use in my day to day testing and itâ€™s a cracking piece of kit for testing with a lot of great features to boot. For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> itâ€™s an app for Chrome that allows you to create HTTP requests for Web and API testing as well as save requests into collections for future use.</p>

<p>Recently <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> has been extended to include a proxy that will save a copy of each request you make in your browser, when enabled, and is extremely useful for various tasks such as rapidly creating collections of requests and modeling a web application.</p>

<p>However, when I first started to use the proxy I found it a bit tricky to setup due to some security restrictions in Chrome that <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> has to work around. I didnâ€™t find much help on Google or StackOverflow so after a bit of fiddling and complaining IÂ  managed to get it working and I thought it would be good to put together a blog post on how to setup the <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> proxy.</p>

<p>Before we start itâ€™s worth saying that <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> is a Chrome application so you will need the Chrome browser installed. If you donâ€™t use Chrome browser there are other tools similar to <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> available (Iâ€™m a big fan of <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/" target="_blank">BurpSuite</a>, something I may blog on another time).</p>
<h3>Install POSTMAN</h3>
<p>So if you havenâ€™t already got <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> installed, head over to the <a href="http://getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN site</a> or download it directly from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop" target="_blank">Google Store</a>. Once installed head over to your <a href="chrome://apps/" target="_blank">Apps</a> page and load up <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a>.</p>
<h3>Install Interceptor</h3>
<p>As I previously mentioned, Chrome has security restrictions in place that limit <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> ability to create requests with custom headers and Cookies (or at least thatâ€™s my take on it). Â  So there is an extension for <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> to workaround these restrictions which is an app in itâ€™s own right called <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/features#interceptor" target="_blank">Interceptor</a>. We want to install <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/features#interceptor" target="_blank">Interceptor</a> which you can grab from the <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> site or again download directly from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-interceptor/aicmkgpgakddgnaphhhpliifpcfhicfo/" target="_blank">Google Store</a>.</p>

<p>Once installed you should see an icon that looks like the one below in the top right corner of the browser which indicates <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/features#interceptor" target="_blank">Interceptor</a> is installed
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-93" src="http://mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/interceptoricon.png" alt="interceptoricon" width="250" height="68" /></p>
<h3>Enable Interceptor</h3>
<p>With <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/features#interceptor" target="_blank">Interceptor</a> installed, click on the traffic light icon to see a popup with a switch set to off. Click on it to turnÂ <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/features#interceptor" target="_blank">Interceptor</a> on and you will see a â€˜Filter requestâ€™ textbox and â€˜Last 10 requestsâ€™ label appear. There will be no requests yet as we still have to connect <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> to <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/features#interceptor" target="_blank">Interceptor</a>.</p>
<h3>Connect POSTMAN to Interceptor</h3>
<p>Head to <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> and locate the highlighted icon shown below in the top toolbar and click on it
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-95" src="http://mwtestconsultancy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/postmanproxy.png" alt="postmanproxy" width="620" height="19" />
You will see two options.Â  The first is a toggle for <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/features#interceptor" target="_blank">Interceptor</a>, click on that to connect <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> to <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/features#interceptor" target="_blank">Interceptor</a>. The second is for the proxy and clicking on that will open a popup with proxy settings. We donâ€™t need to change any of the settings for now so simply click on â€˜Connectâ€™. If everything has gone to plan the popup will indicate the proxy is setup!</p>
<h3>Using the POSTMAN proxy</h3>
<p>Now, with everything setup you can open a new Tab in Chrome, navigate to a site and see requests appear in the History tab of <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> as well in the â€˜Last 10 requestsâ€™ list of the <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/features#interceptor" target="_blank">Interceptor</a> app. If you only want a specific domain to be fed through into the <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> proxy you can update the wildcard â€˜Filter requestsâ€™ setting within <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/features#interceptor" target="_blank">Interceptor</a>. For example if you only wanted Wikipedia requests you could update it to â€˜en.wikipedia.orgâ€™.</p>

<p>And there you have it, <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">POSTMAN</a> proxy setup. Enjoy and feel free to get in touch with me at <a href="https://twitter.com/mwtestconsult" target="_blank">@mwtestconsult</a> if youâ€™re having any difficulties.</p>
